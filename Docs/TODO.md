# TODO:
 Driver:
  - need to seperate the types from the actual wrappers
    have two different folders for types and wrappers also compiled into static libs
 Engine:
    - Need to increase the throughput 
 - in order to run the user has to link both libdriver.a and libpeelfuzz.a be nice if they only have to link one static lib
 - be nice if there was a command to build both the Driver and the Engine at the same time instead of going into both directories in order to do so
